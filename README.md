# Friend-Code-Generator-v2
A 3ds and Switch friend code generator. Originally written in Batch, now written in Python.

**What does this do exactly?**

So, this generates friend codes for the Nintendo 3DS/Wii-U/Switch.
It generates them in either a XXXX-XXXX-XXXX or SW-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX format.
These are completly random and are not verified against a Nintendo server or anything.

**So... is there any point?**

Well, it depends. It's really just something I made because I realised nobody else has made it so I just wanted to get one out there. It may be useful one day, but who knows right now?
